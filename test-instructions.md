# Testing Instructions for Live Preview Fix

## Issue
The live preview stopped updating after clicking the "Compress" button. Once compressed, adjusting compression settings no longer updated the preview.

## Fix Applied
- Added `compressionSettings` field to track what settings were used for compression
- Modified display logic to show live preview when current settings differ from compression settings
- Added visual indicators to show when live preview is being used vs compressed version

## How to Test

1. **Open the application** at http://localhost:3000

2. **Upload an image** using the drop zone

3. **Adjust compression settings** (quality, size, format, etc.)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Live preview should update in real-time
   - ✅ **Expected**: Header should show "Live Preview"

4. **Click the "Compress" button** for the image

5. **Verify compressed state**:
   - ✅ **Expected**: Header should show "Before / After Comparison"
   - ✅ **Expected**: Right label should show "Compressed"
   - ✅ **Expected**: Size info should show "Compressed: X MB"

6. **Adjust compression settings again** (change quality, format, etc.)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Header should show "Live Preview" with "(Settings Changed - Live Preview)" indicator
   - ✅ **Expected**: Right label should show "Live Preview"
   - ✅ **Expected**: Size info should show "Live Preview: X MB"
   - ✅ **Expected**: Preview should update in real-time as you adjust settings

7. **Reset settings to match compression settings**:
   - ✅ **Expected**: Should switch back to showing compressed version
   - ✅ **Expected**: Header should show "Before / After Comparison"

## Debug Information
- Open browser console to see debug logs (DEBUG mode is enabled)
- Look for `[BeforeAfterPreview]` logs showing state changes
- Check `shouldUseLivePreview` and `settingsChanged` values

## Key Indicators of Success
- Live preview continues to work after compression
- Clear visual indicators show when live preview vs compressed version is displayed
- Settings changes immediately trigger live preview generation
- No loss of functionality from the original behavior
